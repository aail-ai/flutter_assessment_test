# Flutter Chat Assessment

A Flutter chat application that demonstrates speech-to-text functionality with a simple bot response system. The app uses Riverpod for state management and local storage for message history by saving the conversation to SharedPreferences. This app also implements a clean architecture approach with separate data, domain, and presentation layers, so it's easier to maintain and extend.

## Features

- Speech-to-Text input for user messages
- Automated bot responses (randomly replies with "yes", "ok", or "no")
- Local message persistence using SharedPreferences
- Modern Material Design UI
- Chat history with refresh capability
- List of previous chat sessions
- State management using Riverpod
